# Following-the-Money-U.S.-Election-Finance-Insights

A Tableau Data Story on How Money Shapes Presidential Elections

This project explores how billions of dollars in political donations influence U.S. presidential elections. Using campaign finance data, the analysis uncovers donation patterns, geographic funding trends, candidate war chests, campaign spending behaviors, and whether financial power truly determines election outcomes.

All dashboards in this project were designed and built using Tableau.

📊 Project Overview

The U.S. election system runs on massive fundraising and spending cycles. But who donates? Where does the money come from? How does it flow through candidates and campaigns? And most importantly—does money actually lead to victory?

This project answers these questions by building a complete narrative across six Tableau dashboards, each focusing on a different part of the campaign finance pipeline.

📁 Dashboards Included
1. Following the Money

How campaign donations shaped elections across 2020–2024.

2. The Donors Speak

Breakdown of who donates to presidential candidates—small donors vs. wealthy contributors.

3. The Geography of Giving

Mapping donor hotspots and state-level funding power.

4. The War Chests

Which candidates captured the most money and how funding shifted over time.

5. The Battleground

Where campaigns invested their billions (ads, digital spend, ground operations, swing-state pushes).

6. The Verdict

Did the biggest spender win, or did strategy outweigh money?
